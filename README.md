# OpenDKIM for Yunohost 

* [OpenDKIM](http://www.opendkim.org/)


DEPRECATED APP. DO NOT USE.
NATIVELY INTEGRATED WITHIN LATEST YUNOHOST RELEASE.


This is a WIP to automate OpenDKIM for Yunohost

At this stage, it will eventually work only for a SINGLE domain.

Please note that for DKIM to work, you will need to change your DNS as per data generated by the app.

A webpage will be generated so that you can see what DKIM key to place in your DNS.

Two keys needs to be added (please change DOMAIN.TLD by your own domain name) : 
- SPF key : 
DOMAIN.TLD 300 TXT "v=spf1 a:DOMAIN.TLD ip4:Server'sIPv4 ip6:Server'sIPv6 mx ?all"

- DKIM key :
cat /etc/opendkim/keys/DOMAIN.TLD/mail.txt

mail._domainkey IN TXT "v=DKIM1; k=rsa; p=AAAKKUHGCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4GNADCBiQKBgQDPFrBM54eXlZPXLJ7EFphiA8qGAcgu4lWuzhzxDDcIHcnA/fdklG2gol1B4r27p87rExxz9hZehJclaiqlaD8otWt8r/UdrAUYNLKNBFGHJ875467jstoAQAB" ; ----- DKIM key mail for DOMAIN.TLD
